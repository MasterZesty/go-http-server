### Go-HTTP-Server

**The HTTP server you never asked for, but I built it anyway.**

Welcome to Go-HTTP-Server, yet another HTTP server in Go—because apparently, the internet doesn’t have enough of those already. If you’ve ever dreamed of handling web requests in the most minimalist, overengineered way possible, then you're in the right place. Seriously, what else would you use Go for? Speed? Efficiency? Nah, we're here for the DIY satisfaction.

### Features (because every repo needs a list)
- **Handles HTTP requests**: Like every other HTTP server in existence, except this one is in Go and makes you feel like a 10x developer.
- **Super lightweight**: Probably too lightweight. I barely added any features because why complicate things with "functionality"?
- **Concurrency**: Go does it for you, but I’ll pretend it was a huge deal getting that working.
- **Error Handling**: There is none. If something breaks, just close your eyes and hope for the best—Go will handle it... or not.
- **Custom Routes**: You get to manually define routes like it's 2003! Take that, modern frameworks!
  
### Setup
1. Clone the repo. Not that you'll need it, but hey, everyone likes clones.
2. Build the binary, if you know how (hint: `go build`—you're welcome).
3. Run it and pretend you understand what's happening. Your server will be up and running in no time—well, assuming you have Go installed and a lot of patience.

### Usage
Just curl it or something. The server listens on `localhost:8080`—because default ports are too mainstream.

### Contributing
Please, no pull requests. This is my masterpiece and clearly cannot be improved.
